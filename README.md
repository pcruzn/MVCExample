# MVCExample
A php site using MVC architectural pattern. 

This example shows an hypothetical express ticket selling website made with PHP and using the MVC architectural pattern. Three design patterns were used here: Page Controller, Template View and Transaction Script.

The idea is simple... An index page shows the buyer some options to select the date, the time and to input a Visa card number. We do not care about other parameters as this is only an example. The controller requests the appropriate actions from the model and then selects an appropriate view to render data.
